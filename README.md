# Arbitragee Util Functions 

## Overview

These functions are a small part of a larger code base that finds and executes profitable arbitrage between centralized exchanges (CEX's) and decentralized exchanges (DEX's).
These are used on the Polygon/Matic ethereum L2 with the help of Paraswap which is a DeFi aggregator.
